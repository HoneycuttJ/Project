## Project Details:
Tipoff is a basic web application designed for simple management tasks related to a youth basketball league. This project aims to provide an intuitive platform for organizing team information, managing schedules, and facilitating statistical changes by league administrators.

## File Organization:
This project is organized in a manner that facilitates easy downloading and running of the application without the need for manual file arrangement. The repository contains all the necessary files and assets, and the project should run smoothly on a local server once the required files and software are installed on the user's device.

**NOTE:** Wampserver was utilized for the initial development and testing of the project. However, other local development environments can also be used to run the application.
